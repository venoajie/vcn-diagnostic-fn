### **Follow-up Prompt: Root Cause Analysis for Application-Specific VCN Failure**

**Objective (The "Why"):**

Our initial hypothesis of a general platform-level VCN integration failure has been **rejected**. The successful invocation of the simple `vcn-diagnostic-fn` proves that the OCI Functions platform *can* correctly prepare a network environment for a function in our target subnet.

This new evidence strongly indicates that the `FunctionInvokeSubnetNotAvailable` error is being triggered by something specific to the `rag-ingestor` function itself. The failure is likely occurring during the function's bootstrap/initialization phase, before our handler code is executed, and is caused by a specific dependency, configuration, or characteristic of its container image.

The new objective is to perform a systematic differential analysis between the working `vcn-diagnostic-fn` and the failing `rag-ingestor` to pinpoint the exact component causing the platform to fail during network setup.

**Context & Known State:**

*   **Working Baseline:** `vcn-diagnostic-fn` (simple, `fdk` only, small image, no env vars) successfully invokes inside the VCN.
*   **Failing Subject:** `rag-ingestor` (complex, multiple dependencies including `oci`, `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg`, larger image, env vars) fails with `FunctionInvokeSubnetNotAvailable`.
*   **Conclusion:** The root cause lies within the delta of complexity between these two functions.

**Execution Plan: A Step-by-Step Process of Elimination**

We will start with the working baseline (`vcn-diagnostic-fn`) and incrementally add layers of complexity from `rag-ingestor` until the failure is reproduced.

1.  **Phase 1: Dependency Analysis (Most Likely Culprit)**
    *   **Goal:** Determine if a specific Python library is triggering the failure.
    *   **Action:** Create a series of test functions, starting with a copy of `vcn-diagnostic-fn`. In each step, add one new library from `rag-ingestor`'s `requirements.txt`, deploy, and invoke.
        *   **Test 1.1 (OCI SDK):** Add `oci` to `requirements.txt`. Deploy as `test-fn-oci`. Invoke and check logs.
        *   **Test 1.2 (SQLAlchemy):** Add `sqlalchemy` to `requirements.txt`. Deploy as `test-fn-sqlalchemy`. Invoke and check logs.
        *   **Test 1.3 (Database Driver):** Add `psycopg` and `pgvector` to `requirements.txt`. This is a critical test, as `psycopg` has native C dependencies. Deploy as `test-fn-psycopg`. Invoke and check logs.
    *   **Analysis:** The first test that fails with `FunctionInvokeSubnetNotAvailable` identifies the problematic library.

2.  **Phase 2: Initialization Code Analysis**
    *   **Goal:** If all dependency tests pass, determine if the *initialization* of a library (the `import` statements or global client initializations) is the trigger.
    *   **Action:** Take the full `rag-ingestor` `func.py` code and comment out the entire body of the `handler` function, leaving only the `import` statements and global variable definitions. Deploy this "gutted" function.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   If this "gutted" function **fails**, the problem is with a module-level import or a global variable initialization that runs when the function container starts.
        *   If this "gutted" function **succeeds**, the problem is within the code that was commented out, which runs *after* the network is successfully initialized. This would be a very surprising result, as it would contradict the error message, but it must be tested.

3.  **Phase 3: Configuration and Environment Analysis**
    *   **Goal:** Determine if the presence of environment variables is a factor.
    *   **Action:** Take the working `vcn-diagnostic-fn` and add the same environment variables (`DB_SECRET_OCID`, `OCI_NAMESPACE`) that `rag-ingestor` uses, but do not add any code that reads them. Deploy and invoke.
    *   **Analysis:** If this function fails, it points to a rare issue where the platform's handling of function configuration interacts negatively with VCN setup.

**Final Deliverable:**

Based on the results of this investigation, provide a definitive conclusion that answers the following question:

**"What is the single, specific difference between the diagnostic function and the ingestor function that causes the OCI platform to fail with `FunctionInvokeSubnetNotAvailable`?"**

The deliverable should be a clear statement, such as "The failure is triggered by the inclusion of the `psycopg` library," or "The failure occurs when the `oci.secrets.SecretsClient` is initialized at the global scope." This will provide the final, precise piece of information needed to either fix the issue or report a highly specific bug to Oracle Support.
